HW challenge #2
    n this assignment, I am asked to apply the concepts I have learned to complete the required PyBank Python activity and, if I wish to stretch my skills even further, the optional PyRamen Python activity. Both activities present a real-world situation in which my newfound Python skills will come in handy.

    The PyBank activity involves analyzing a dataset of financial transactions from a fictitious bank. The goal of the activity is to answer a series of questions about the data, such as:

        What was the total amount of profit/loss over the entire period?

    What was the average monthly profit/loss?
    What was the month with the highest profit?
    What was the month with the lowest loss?

    To complete the PyBank activity, I will need to use Python skills such as:

        Importing and manipulating data

    Analyzing data using statistical methods
    Visualizing data using charts and graphs

    The PyRamen activity is similar to the PyBank activity, but it involves analyzing a dataset of financial transactions from a fictitious ramen restaurant. The goal of the activity is to answer a series of questions about the data, such as:

        What was the total amount of revenue generated over the entire period?

    What was the average monthly revenue?
    What was the month with the highest revenue?
    What was the month with the lowest revenue?

    To complete the PyRamen activity, I will need to use Python skills similar to those used in the PyBank activity.
